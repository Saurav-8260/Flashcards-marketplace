# ðŸ“š On-chain Flashcards Marketplace

## 1. Project Title
**On-chain Flashcards Marketplace â€“ Buy & Sell Study Decks on the Blockchain**

---

## 2. Project Description
This project is a decentralized application (dApp) built using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It allows users to:
- **List study flashcard decks** with a price, title, and description.
- **Buy decks** securely using STX, ensuring ownership is recorded on-chain.

Each flashcard deck is uniquely identified and securely owned by the creator, and buyers gain permanent access by purchasing through a trustless transaction.

---

## 3. Project Vision
To empower students, educators, and content creators with a decentralized educational platform where high-quality study material can be:
- Shared
- Sold
- Verified
- Traded

All while ensuring ownership, transparency, and censorship-resistance.

---

## 4. Future Scope
- Add functionality to **upload actual flashcards** (as metadata or IPFS hash).
- Enable **rating and reviews** for decks.
- Allow **resale of owned decks** in a secondary marketplace.
- Support **NFT-based ownership** of exclusive educational content.
- Implement **subscription-based** or **bundled deck offers**.
- Launch a **community DAO** to curate and moderate content.
